The reason why FD schema has way less table number than E-R schema is that BCNF is hard to represent self-relationship, subclass, 
single-attribute entities and the difference between many-to-one and many-to-"exactly one", so it's not a really good decomposition technique. 
In our point of view, we think if we aim to create correct tables, then using E-R schema would be more accurate.
However, we can only add appropriate constraints with normal form technique.

Redundancies:

E-R Schema might have redundancies exist within it. However, with functional dependencies and normal form, we can reduce unnecessary redundancies, 
making the whole design more simplified and clear.

Null value:

FD would accept Null value as long as one input will correspond to only one output.
E-R relationship can restrict Null value by using -) but beside that there don't have many regulations. 

Unique:

FD can figure out where should have unique constraint but E-R relation can't.
